SA Software tracepoints log file
 
The C:/Users/Chris/codewarrior_workspace/DataloggerMasterCode/Project_Settings/Startup_Code/kinetis_sysinit.c file was updated to add  sa_interrupt_handler for SVC interrupts.
 
The "sa_handler.c" file was added to sa_sources folder. This file contains 
the interrupt handler for SVC which stops and starts the trace collection.
 
.swtp section was added to LCF file - used by Software Tracepoints mechanism 
to save tracepoints. Do not change the name of this section.
 
**** Original LCF file was saved in ${ProjDirPath}/sa_backup/ ****
